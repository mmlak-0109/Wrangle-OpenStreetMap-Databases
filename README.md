## Welcome to my "Wrangle OpenStreetMap Databases" Project Page!

In this project I wrangled the XML OpenStreetMap data for Los Angeles, CA.  I then used data munging techniques to assess the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity.  To finish it off, I used SQL to store, query, and aggregate the data.

Both the original `.ipynb` file and the generated `.html` file can be found by clicking the "View on GitHub" link above.
