## Welcome to my "Wrangle OpenStreetMap Databases" Project Page!

I completed this project for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree "Data Wrangling" and "SQL for Data Analysis" courses.

In these classes we learned how to do the following things:

- Assess the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity.
- Parsing and gather data from popular file formats such as .json, .xml, .csv, and .html.
- Process data from many files and very large files that can be cleaned with spreadsheet programs
- Learn how to store, query, and aggregate data using SQL

In this project I wrangled the XML OpenStreetMap data for Los Angeles, CA.  I then used data munging techniques to assess the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity.  To finish it off, I used SQL to store, query, and aggregate the data.

Both the original `.ipynb` file and the generated `.html` file can be found by clicking the "View on GitHub" link above.

Enjoy!
